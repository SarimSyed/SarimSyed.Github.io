                            I came up with a simple game where you dodge asteroids; the goal is just to reach the end without dying.

                            We had to make an app to keep track of inventory items. It very simple to use, you can add items, name them, give them a quantity, and assign a category.

                            This is one of the projects I am very proud of. It was made in collaboration With Emmanuelle Oleszczuk and Angela Shanmugam. This is a website Called Stick-It which we made for our Web 2 final project.
                            It is a website where a user can create little notes which would be stored in a databse and allow the user to refer to them later on to remember whatever it was they noted down. 
                            The notes can be color coded based on the assigned category whih offered another layer of organization and customization. The notes could also be marked done which would remove it from the main screen but still be able to be accessed from the "Completed Post-Its page".We utilized JavaScript, HandleBars, Node.js, MySQL, Docker, and a ton of CSS to complete it.

                            This project was made to learn about ASP.NET as well as understand the MVC relationship in web programming with C#.
                            Its a very simple page that requires a bit of information about the sender and it sends an email with the message the user inputs to the email they provide.
                            It requires a SendGrid account to send E-mails.
