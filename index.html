        <p id="aboutMeDesc">
            I am a Computer Science student at John Abbott College currently in my third year. 
            This site will highlight some of the projects I've worked on during my time in the program.
            

            My interests include drawing, writing, coding, learning about new topics, tinkering with electronics, sometimes I dabble in some videogames.

                            I came up with a simple game where you dodge asteroids; the goal is just to reach the end without dying.

                            We had to make an app kept track of shopping items. It very simple to use, you can add items, name them, give them a quantity, and assign a category.

                            This project was made to learn about ASP.NET as well as understand the MVC relationship in web programming with C#.
                            Its a very simple page that requires a bit of information about the sender and it sends an email with the message the user inputs to the email they provide.
                            It requires a SendGrid account to send E-mails.
